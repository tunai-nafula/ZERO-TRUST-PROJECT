# ZERO-TRUST-PROJECT

This project sets up a fully secure, SSH-free AWS environment using Terraform. EC2 instances are accessed only through AWS Systems Manager, eliminating the need for open ports or key pairs. It also includes CloudTrail auditing, KMS encryption, and hardened S3 logging to provide a strong, enterprise-grade security baseline.
